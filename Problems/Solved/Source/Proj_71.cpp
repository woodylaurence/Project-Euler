 *      Problem: List all reduced fractions n/d for n < d and d ² 1,000,000 in order, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.
 *
 *      SOLVED USING LOGIC: Multiply numerator and denominator by highest factor where denominator < 1,000,000 (142857): 3/7 =  428571/999999, thus fraction
 *      immediately before this will be 428570/999999
